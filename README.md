# PyDevMgr

PyDevMgr provides a desktop GUI for launching shell scripts and applications. The launch parameters are stored in a YAML file in the application directory. This project uses the wxPython library to provide cross-platform support.

The PyDevMgr displays the names of the tasks, sorted in a descending order based on the number of times the task has been invoked.
